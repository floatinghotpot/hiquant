## Hiquant

[阅读此文档的中文版本](https://github.com/floatinghotpot/hiquant/blob/master/README_zh.md)

Hiquant is an out-of-box tool and framework for quantitative trading and study.

It can run on any OS with Python 3, suggest Python v3.7+. 

This software is developed on Mac, and the examples in this document are written with Mac environment. They are similiar for Linux, but might be a little difference on Windows.

## Features

![Hiquant system architecture](https://github.com/floatinghotpot/hiquant/raw/master/docs/hiquant.png)

- **Data acquisition**: fetch the list of stocks and indices, fetch financial reports, historical market quotations, real-time market data, and PE/PB data from financial websites
- **Value analysis**: extract key financial data from financial reports, calculate annual profit, ROE, net asset growth rate and other indicators, and screen out "value investment" stocks based on specified filter conditions
- **Valuation analysis**: calculate PE/PB percentiles from PE/PB data, and select “cheap valuation” stocks based on specified filter conditions
- **Stock pool**: Contains a command to create a "stock pool" csv file, and provides operations such as merging, removing, and intersection
- **Strategy Pool**: with some trading strategy codes for demo purposes, and provides a command to create a new strategy from the template, which is convenient for users to write their own strategies
- **Multi-portfolio**: with some fund strategy configurations for demo purposes, and provides a command to create a new configuration from the template
- **Simulated backtrade**: Use historical market data to simulate backtesting of one or more portfolio strategies, output data analysis of investment returns, and draw yield curves for comparison
- **Simulated realtime trading**: Synchronize real-time market data, calculate trading decisions based on strategies, and send email notifications to remind users to trade
- **Multi markets**: currently supports China market (mainland and Hongkong) and USA market, will add support for markets in other countries
- **TODO: Automated trading**: call the quantitative trading interface to realize automated trading (not yet implemented, planned)

Other additional features:
- **K-line chart**: plot the K-line chart of stocks/indices, including plotting common technical indicators, comparing the profit results of trading based on the indicators
- **Multi-indicator combination**: When drawing a K-line chart, you can also mix signals from multiple indicators for trading, and display trading actions, holding time, and yield curve
- **Candle patterns**: graphically display the 61 K-line patterns provided by TALib, count the number of occurrences of each pattern in the local daily data, and verify the correctness of these patterns for trend prediction
- **Indicator test**: Use historical data and technical indicators to test the stocks in the stock pool and find the most effective technical indicators for each stock

## Code quick start

```python
import pandas as pd
import talib
import hiquant as hq

class MyStrategy( hq.BasicStrategy ):
    def __init__(self, fund):
        super().__init__(fund, __file__)

    def select_stock(self):
        return ['AAPL','GOOG','AMZN','TSLA','FB','MSFT','NFLX', 'SONY']

    def gen_trade_signal(self, symbol, init_data = False):
        market = self.fund.market
        if init_data:
            df = market.get_daily(symbol)
        else:
            df = market.get_daily(symbol, end = market.current_date, count = 26+9)

        dif, dea, macd_hist = talib.MACD(df.close, fastperiod=12, slowperiod=26, signalperiod=9)
        return pd.Series( hq.CROSS(dif, dea), index=df.index )

    def get_signal_comment(self, symbol, signal):
        return 'MACD golden cross' if (signal > 0) else 'MACD dead cross'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    backtest_args = dict(
        #start_cash= 1000000.00,
        #date_start= hq.date_from_str('3 years ago'),
        #date_end= hq.date_from_str('yesterday'),
        #out_file= 'output/demo.png',
        #parallel= True,
        compare_index= '^GSPC',
    )
    hq.backtest_strategy( MyStrategy, **backtest_args )
```
